Cocoapods Search Workflow for Alfred
================================

A simple workflow for searching CocoaPods.

**Notes:**

- The script is written in Python and it uses the BeautifulSoup module in order to execute XPath queries (if someone knows a way of using a stock library compatible with Python 2.6x+ feel free to contact me)

- The portion of code that executes the request against cocoapods.org comes from _StackOverflow_ workflow by xhinking
- Cocoapods.org doesn't have a public api for their search, so the whole thing is nothing more than a hack
